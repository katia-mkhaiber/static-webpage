In this level we used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
A static webpage include 3 pages: homepage, aboutpage, and contactpage.
Every page is written as a seperate  HTML file(homepage.html, aboutpage.html, and contactpage.html) and CSS style in every page.
They are connected using a navigation bar, image, and footer.
homepage.html is the entry point of the webpage. It include navigation bar, image, and footer as HTML, and as CSS I used the style for body, h1, h2, p, and div. Under h1 we have navigation bar and unordered list(<ul></ul>).
aboutpage.html is the introduction of the owner of webpage. It also include navigation bar(<ul></ul>), h1 & h2, footer,form and image.
conatctpage.html is the visitor can reach us it includes navigation bar, image,form and footer.
And also we'll not forget that every page has a CSS for styling.
In our pages I used also dropdown, and modal with CSS style.
